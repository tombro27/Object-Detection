# Object Detection

In this project I have used python and openCV to identify the different objects in an image or a video(live feed).

The mobilenet-ssd model is a Single-Shot multibox Detection (SSD) network intended to perform object detection. This model is implemented using the Caffe framework. COCO SSD MobileNet v3 is used here for faster and better results.

## What Output looks like?

### Input 1
![Input Dog Image](https://github.com/tombro27/Object-Detection/blob/main/dog.jpg)

### Output 1

### Input 2
![Input Car Image](https://github.com/tombro27/Object-Detection/blob/main/car.jpg) 

### Output 2

__*For image as input use main_image.py script and for input as video use main_video.py script.*__
